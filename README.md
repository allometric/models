# models

This repository stores allometric models used in the R package `allometric`. 
Because there are thousands of allometric models in existence, a separate
repository is needed to store and track their development. This repository
is used for this purpose. We treat `models` as a data repository, and not as
an R package.

Users interested in *contributing* models to `allometric` are in the right 
location. Users interested in *using* allometric models for analysis, please
refer to the [`allometric`](https://github.com/allometric/allometric) package.

# Versioning

This repository is versioned separately from `allometric` using
[`semantic-release`](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release),
a Node.js tool that facilitates semantic versioning. This enables a rigid
release framework for new allometric models and modifications therein.
